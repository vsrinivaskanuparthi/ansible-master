Ansible Installation

Create 2 or more Machines  and name one as Control Server and others as Remote machines
Control  Server (RHEL):
  
   Controll server set up steps

        vi  /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf  and change enable=0  to disabale redhat subcriptions.

   1  rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
   2  yum update
   3  yum install ansible
   4  ansible --version
   5  yum update
   6  adduser demo_user
   7  passwd demo_user

      # To give root privileges to ansible user
   8  visudo (command and at the bottom we need to add user which is created and nopasswd:all we have to mention) then we are going to give root previleges to the newly created user  ( demo_user ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD:ALL)

     

      # By default in AWS OS images are designed for password less(.pem/.ppk Key based authentication) authentication
      # SO we have to make it password based authentication for ansible user to communicate.
   9  vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   
      passwordAuthentication = yes
      permitrootlogin yes

   10 service sshd restart
   11 su - demo_user
      
      # Ansible communicates via ssh , so generate SSH keys and ID's and copy them into remote machine.
   12 ssh-keygen
   
   
EXECUTE REMOTE MACHINE STEPS listed in complete bottom of this page ON ALL REMOTE MACHINES and then continue from step 13

   13  ssh-copy-id demo_user@<private Ip address/ DNS>
       ssh-copy-id demo-user@172.31.19.7/ DNS
   14  ssh <private Ip address/ DNS>  
ssh 172.31.19.7
 
       # you should be able to login to remote machine with out password prompt
   15  cd /etc/ansible/
   16  ls
   17  sudo mv hosts hosts.ori
   18  sudo vi hosts

   	[webserver]
   	<private Ip address/ DNS> #  pvt dns/ IP  of remote host

   19  ansible webserver -m  ping

 Remote Machine set up steps  (RHEL)
 
    1  yum update -y
    2  adduser demo_user
    3  passwd demo_user
    4  visudo

       Demo_user ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD:ALL

    5   vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      
       passwordAuthentication = yes
       permitrootlogin yes

    6  service sshd restart 






after setup


ansible dev.group -b -m yum -a "name=httpd state=latest"

	
ansible dev.group -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"





sudo vi install_httpd.yaml

ansible-playbook -b  httpd_install.yml 


       


ansible group1 -m setup -a "filter=*ipv4*"

ansible group1 -m setup
ip address={{ansible_all_ipv4_addrrese}}
vi xyz.conf.j2

======
ansible group1 -m setup -a "filter=*os_family*"

==========================================

- hosts: all
  vars:

ansible-plabook -b -e pkg_name=wget xyz.yml
(the e stands for extra variables for -e we can write also --extra-vars)
